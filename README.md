# Water Quality in Padova's Canals
Course project for *Nature in Context* on the Water quality in the canals of Padova. A.Y. 2025/26. Goal: Determine the main factors (human, natural) driving dissolved oxygen variability in the canals of Padova in dry and wet weather. (E.g. light, temperature, rainfall, hydraulic gate operation and water levels, …).

The project consists of the following files and folders:
- **WaterQualityData.xsxl**: Excel spreadsheet containing data on Dissolved oxygen, hydraulic gate operation, weather conditions etc.
- **miniDOT_playground.m**: MATLAB code exploring the Dissolved Oxygen and Water temperature data.
- **Matlab_playground.m**: MATLAB code exploring the available data.
